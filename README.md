# TAO Barcode Scanner

![flow chart](diagram.png?raw=true)

TAO Barcode Scanner is a project that provides a react.js front end client designed to handle the tracking of attendance at events by means of barcode scans. It both serves a react.js app to the browser, and also acts as an intermediary between said client and a secondary server by making the appropriate API calls to fetch any data it needs.

It is also capable of generating badges with the required barcodes in real-time.
